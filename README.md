# Hackathon Heroes

A text-only sci-fi combat game. This was made for the boot.dev Hackathon 2025.



This game runs in the terminal.



\##Installation

1. Clone the repo from GitHub.

2\. Install python 3 if you don't have it already.

3\. Run the file main.py from the src directory.



\##Playing the game

Other than typing a name for your character at the start of the game, all your options will appear in a numbered list. Simply type the number of your choice and hit Enter.



\##Game features

The game has four character class: human, robot, mutant and cyborg. Each class starts with different stats. These affect hit chance, armor, HP and resistances or weaknesses to certain damage types. Each level consists of a group of enemies chosen at random from a list. When you have reduced all the enemies to 0 HP, the level is complete. At this point, you will receive a random selection of loot and some experience points that improve your character. As you progress through the levels, more enemies will appear. After a certain point, some of these enemies will be stronger, as well as appearing in larger groups. The game runs until you either clear 10 levels or run out of HP.



Important note: There is no save game feature, so each play-through starts at the beginning with character creation.





\##Quality

I have not play-tested the game for difficulty or fairness. It may be pretty easy, or it may be unbeatable.



I am a noob coder, so this whole thing is pretty rudimentary. I am open to feedback, suggestions and criticism. Just be nice!
